## SenseCraft HMI v1.4.0 Release Notes
Release time: 2026.04.10


>This release was split across two weeks (last week + today). Sorry for no heads-up last time. Going forward, we're opening up our dev roadmap and collecting feedback in a public doc.


### Designer Updates

#### Weather Widget
- New parameters: Date, Daily Average Temperature, Weather Code in Text, and many more
- Unit settings: now you can choose which temperature/speed/rain sum units to display

#### Calendar Widget
- Added "Week starts on" setting – choose Sunday or Monday
